Between December 2018 and December 2019, AT&T evolved from a Telecom client into a Telecom-media-entertainment-streaming-fiber-optic-content-publisher... client thing.  
  
After their acquisition of WarnerMedia, the brand's TOV needed to expand from cell phone plans to evening plans for watching Game of Thrones. At some point, Taylor Swift's cats got involved... and by December 2019, our team was getting briefed on some new streaming platform that would eventually be called HBO Max.  
  
Long story short: It was a busy year for AT&T's adopted mega-family of clients. There were a few curveballs along the way, but the team swung for the fences every time.
