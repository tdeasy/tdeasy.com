Over the the last few years, I've had various opportunities to produce creative for Apple Music and Beats by Dre.  
  
As the brand evolved, the client sought new voices to champion music. The earlier work focused on literal rockstars and mega-athletes, while the latest work represented Beat's transition to a more personal voice.  
  
Naturally, I was happy to help capture and develop each of these narratives through the years.
