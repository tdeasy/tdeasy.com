How do you rebrand an aging American luxury automaker? By recruiting a new, more daring breed of drivers.  
  
Our team developed a broad series of partnerships and digital experiences that sought to redefine what it meant to be a contemporary Cadillac owner.  
  
We began with a series of geo-targeted challenges that encouraged users to seek out new brand-aligned experiences around them. A curated list of locations and a slowly pixilating image of a Cadillac CTS key fob helped gamify the adventure. Those who went the distance and attended the final event got handsomely rewarded with a brand new Cadillac CTS 2-door coupe.  
  
Additionally, Partnerships with Mr.Porter, Uncrate, and Kickstarter helped visualize the new Cadillac lifestyle in unexpected ways.
