For over a decade, I've had the opportunity to wear various hats for the luxury clothing brand OFF–WHITE™.  
  
In terms of my contribution to the brand, I often joke that I've lived a double life. I first met the brand's late founder, Virgil Abloh, during my last semester of grad school. Thanks to the nine-hour time difference between San Francisco and Milan, I'd spend the day working at AKQA SF while dedicating the hours of 12 am-7 am PST to the (then) fledgling brand.  
  
Fast forward to today, and the brand has become one of the most ubiquitous names in contemporary fashion. Watching the original six-person team develop into a global brand acquired for $1 Billion by LVMH in 2018 will forever be one of the proudest experiences of my career.
